Workflow to get the required files:

Make sure you have a recent version of QGIS installed (http://www.qgis.org/en/site/). Note that in older versions of QGIS (such as 2.0 Darfur), you will not be able to follow this proceedure. If you do not have access to a recent version of QGIS, don't worry, the file require for executing the rest of the scripts (polygons.csv) are already in this repository.

In the QGIS folder, open up 'shear_stress.shp' in QGIS, and follow the procedure below:

# > Open shapefile
# > Layer dropdown menu > save as
# > in the options, change "Symbology Export" to "feature symbology", and "Geometry" as "AS_WKT".
# > Change the CRS to WGS 84, or else it will not export the points as latitude/longitude, if that is desired
# > make sure it has the filename "polygons.csv", and put it in the base folder (i.e. Greenland_final/shear_stress/)

Execute the following commands in the command line.


----------
make create_ss_grid
make convert_grid
bash create_shear_stress_files.sh
-----------


Note that if you are running this on a Mac, you will need to make a change in 'create_shear_stress_files.sh'. Read the comments in the script to make the appropriate change.
