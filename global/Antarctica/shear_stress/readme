shear_stress_now.gmt is a GMT formatted polygon file containing a shear stress model that produces an ice sheet reconstruction of 
modern day Antarctica that matches the BEDMAP2 ice thicknesses within 25 m (media value within each domain)


October 15, 2018 - deleted domain 454 and merged it with 187, as it was a sliver
                 - Merged domain 625 with 94, as it was very small and had a huge contrast in shear stress that might cause problems
                 - increased the default shear stress of domain 68 to 5000, as it was causing the program to mess up since there was a high shear stress contrast

Note: at this point, the maximum domain number is 693, so new domains are greater than this

I am making the shelf regions that are currently not covered in grounded ice having a really low shear stress (i.e. less than 10000 Pa). This will better correspond to the observations of limited ice thickness growth at the LGM. I als0 am merging adjacent regions that have similar shear stress values.

Merge: 89 --> 90
Merge 76 --> with adjacent regions
Merge 72 --> 70
Merge 65 --> 63
Merge 76 --> 80

For the offshore regions, I used the following rules

places with deep topography: 5000 Pa
places with some uplands or islands: 10000 Pa

Merged together all the Ross Shelf region together, made two shear stress regions:

694: upstream Ross Shelf
695: outer Ross Shelf

697 - East Atarctica, outside of Ross Shelf region
698 - East Antarctica
699 - East Anarctica - place with some higher ridges
700 - East Antarctica
701 - East Antarctica
702 - East Antarctica - place with some higher ridges
703 - East Antarctica
704 - Prydz Bay (I set this to 30000
705 - outer Prydz Bay
706 - East Antarctica - place with some higher ridges
707 - East Antarctica
708 - East Antarctica - place with some islands
709 - East Antarctica
710 - East Antarctica - place with some islands
711 - East Antarctica - beside Ronne-Filchner Ice Shelf
712 - Ronne-Filchner outer shelf
713 - Filchner shelf region
714 - Southern Ronne-Filchner Shelf
715 - Ronne Shelf region\
716 - Eastern side of West Antarctica Peninsula
717 - Northern part of Antarctic Pensinsula
718 - western part of West Antarctic Peninsula
719 - West Antarctica
720 - West Antarctica
Merge 601 --> 659
Merge 123, 124, 125 --> 126
Merge 121 --> 120
