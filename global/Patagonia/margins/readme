The margins are currently set up in the following way:

30000-18000: use the same margin, which is from Ehlers et al (2011).

13000-present: use the same margin, which is simplified from the GLIMS database (Raup et al., 2007).

For the time slices between that, I interpolated between the LGM and modern margin, using Contour Interpolation (https://github.com/evangowan/contour_interpolation). I tried to have it
retreat backwards through deep fjords, so that it is realistic retreat.

I fully intend to replace this with Bethan Davies's margins, as soon as they become available.
