Times when there is no expanded ice caps/sheets on Barents Sea islands, I used modern ice extents from the GLIMS dataset

- 30000: intermediate Dated 31 and 29 ka
- 32500: placed the margin on the edge of the modern day coastline along Sweden, ice cap on Scotland, Svalbard is a unified ice sheet
- 35000: DATED-1 35-38 ka maximum
- 37500: intermediate of the 40000 and 35000 time slizes
- 40000: DATED-1 35-38 ka minimum
- 42500: intermediate of 40000 and 45000
- 45000: Expansion of the Scandinavian ice sheet into Baltic Sea, to reflect Heinrich 4 (See Hughes et al 2016 for discussion of pre-40ka advance). Not as much as 31000 advance
- 47500: intermediate of 50000 and 45000
- 50000: Helmens 2014 MIS 3
- 52500: still extended into Baltic Sea, but reduced from 55000
- 55000: Ingolfsson and Landvik 2013 fig 13e
- 57500: Separated British Ice Sheet from 60000, but still connected Barents Sea, similar to MIS 2 deglaciation
- 60000: Ingolfsson and Landvik 2013 fig 13d + Helmens 2014
- 62500: Separate British-Ice Sheet at this time, but otherwise similar limits to 60000 and 65000
- 65000: Ingolfsson and Landvik 2013 fig 13c
- 67500: set it to be intermediate of 65000 and 70000
- 70000: Ingolfsson and Landvik 2013 fig 13e
- 75000: Hand drawn by Evan to be isolated ice caps on the Arctic islands and Fennoscandia
- 80000: DATED-1 35-38 ka minimum

I have 2500 year time slices for 70000 to 30000, but I need to make them for times after 30000.

For 2500, 5000 and 7500, I set it to be identical to modern extents

For 12500, 17500, 22500 and 27500, I set it to be intermediate of the DATED most likely reconstruction time slices

12500 - since this is the Younger Dryas, I think that it will be closer to the 13000 than the 12000 time slice. 

I added the modern Novoya Zemlya margin to all time slices where it was not covered with the Eurasian ice sheet

There is some discrepancy for the Franz Joseph Islands and between the British Islands and Scandinavia between the 29000/27000 and 25000 time slices. I have made no attempts to edit the 25000 margin, I will ask Anna Hughes about this another time (I imagine the discrepancy will be resolved in DATED-2)
